# Client library examples

Examples of usage of FusionAuth client libraries to configure and manage FusionAuth. 

There's a readme in each of the language subdirectories.

You can [learn more about our client libraries.](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/)

## Install FusionAuth Locally

If you have docker, you can install FusionAuth locally to test out these scripts.

* Clone this repository
* Run `docker-compose up` to stand up FusionAuth.
* Use [the API key found in the kickstart file](/kickstart/kickstart.json#L8) whenever one is needed.
* Review the README in each directory for how to run the scripts.
