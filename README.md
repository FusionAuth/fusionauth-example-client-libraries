# Client library examples

Examples of usage of FusionAuth client libraries to configure and manage FusionAuth. 

There's a readme in each of the language subdirectories.

You can learn more about our client libraries here: https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/

## Install FusionAuth Locally

If you have docker, you can install FusionAuth locally to test out these scripts.

Run `docker-compose up` to stand up FusionAuth.

Then use [the API key found in the kickstart file](/kickstart/kickstart.json#L8) whenever one is needed.

## TODO

Add testing.
